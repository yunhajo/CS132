                <h2>A Diphenyl-Substituted Acridane PNP Ligand Platform for 
                    Small Molecule Activation</h2>
                <p>
                Worked on synthesis of diphenyl-substituted acridane PNP ligand 
                as visiting researcher at Prof. Yunho Leeâ€™s 
                <a href = https://sites.google.com/site/yunholab/home?authuser=0>
                Inorganic Molecule Conversion lab</a> at SNU. Synthesized ligand 
                was utilized in conversion of CO2 into CO in carbon monoxide 
                dehydrogenase reaction. 
                
                The synthesized compound was Diphenyl-Substituted Acrindane PNP.
                The compound is a useful ligand in CO2 conversion
                into CO.

                Done as part of SURF program at Caltech.

                <p>
                A scientific research camp organized by pharmaceutical companies. 
                Worked with professional researchers to learn lab techniques and 
                experience the research process. Replicated experiments done to 
                research Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a possible cure for cancer.

                <h2>Investigating the Effectiveness of Bacteriocin with Silver 
                    Nanoparticles</h2>
                <p>Tested the effectiveness of bacteriocin produced from l.sakei 
                    combined with silver nanoparticles produced from TCM. Applied 
                    results to create films made from pullulan for extending the 
                    shelf life of food products. The research paper published in

                <h2>Effect of experimental therapy combined with music on the viral 
                    load of SARS-CoV-2</h2>
                <p>A team of experts and students researched healing properties of 
                    music to investigate the correlation between the virus and the 
                    immune system through the fusion of music and science. Submitted 
                    a research proposition to Korea Research Institute of 
                    Bioscience & Biotechnology.
